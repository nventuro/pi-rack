# pi-rack
Real time audio effects with a RaspberryPi, with buttons and potentiometers integration.

# RaspberryPi
A standard [Raspbian (Debian Wheezy)](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest) works just fine.
## USB Audio
Since the Pi doesn't have any audio inputs (and the quality of its output jack is rather bad), a USB audio adapter is required. There are tons of cheap options (under $5), the one I have is listed by `lsusb` as `ID 0d8c:013c C-Media Electronics, Inc. CM108 Audio Controller`.
